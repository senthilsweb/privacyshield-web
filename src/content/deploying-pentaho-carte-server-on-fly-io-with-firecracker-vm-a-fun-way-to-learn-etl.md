This is a quick guide on deploying the **Pentaho Carte Server** on <a class="dark:text-teal-400 relative transition hover:text-teal-500 dark:hover:text-teal-400" href="http://fly.io/">Fly.io</a> using **Firecracker VM**â€”a great way to learn and practice the Pentaho data platform with the Pentaho Data Integration **carte** server.

**Carte** is a lightweight web container that allows you to set up a dedicated, remote ETL server, making it easier to manage and execute Pentaho jobs.

### Firecracker

**Firecracker** is a lightweight virtualization technology designed to run microVMs (micro virtual machines) efficiently. <a class="dark:text-teal-400 relative transition hover:text-teal-500 dark:hover:text-teal-400" href="http://fly.io/">Fly.io</a> is a platform that allows you to deploy applications globally with minimal latency, utilizing Firecracker for fast, scalable deployment. Itâ€™s important to note that Firecracker is not Docker; it offers a different approach to virtualization, emphasizing speed and resource efficiency.

Why <a class="dark:text-teal-400 relative transition hover:text-teal-500 dark:hover:text-teal-400" href="http://fly.io/">Fly.io</a> is Perfect for Learning and Practicing Pentaho Data Integration?
